# Variables in Python

# Variables are used to store values in memory
# Variables are created when you assign a value to it

# Integer
x = 5
print(x)

# String
x = "Hello World"
print(x)

# Float (floating point number)
x = 20.5
print(x)

# Boolean
x = True
print(x)

# Multiple Assignment
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# Assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# Variable Names Rules

1. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    For Example: age is not the same as Age
2. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    For Example: _age and age_1 are  valid variable names
3. A variable name cannot start with a number
    For Example: 1age is not a valid variable name
4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    For Example: my-age and my age are not valid variable names
